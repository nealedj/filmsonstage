            We never expected Scarborough to have a world class theatre. This cinema epitomises the sort of place we like to stumble upon when
            we travel around. And that is exactly what we did.

            We were on holiday in North Yorkshire in late November. If that fact alone wasn't going to fairly heavily restrict the normal activities
            one might normally look to doing there we were also there during some very major flooding which prevented us from getting to
            many of the areas we were hoping to visit. Scarborough was one of a number of places we arrived at whilst meandering around the county.

            The theatre itself has a modest exterior - but no one really cares about that anyway. The interior is beautiful, as it should be, the
            venue's primary purpose is as a theatre. It simply acts as a cinema part-time - you know, to pay the bills. The seating was comfortable
            enough though left slightly wanting for leg room.
        </p>

        <p>
            The seating arrangement is definitely a theatre arrangement rather than the usual you
            would expect in a cinema. When you buy your ticket you'll be asked the briefly perplexing question "where would you like to sit?" whilst
            being presented with a floorplan of the venue. We helpfully remembered a study which concluded that the best viewing experience can be
            had watching anywhere with a direct vertical viewing angle and slightly to the right. In reality, we didn't care but they clearly did.
        </p>

        <p>
            The presentation itself had the typical endearing sound sync / screen rotation problems at the start but they were sorted out in no time.
            The sound was a little on the quiet side during quiet passages but luckily we were watching an action film and there weren't so many of
            them.

            Something we didn't realise that was offered but we wish we had done is a film supper. We always enjoy visiting Fellinis in Ambleside,
            Cumbria to do this (I must blog on that one...). The film supper costs Â£14.50 which, from memory, is near the cost of a meal there so
            I guess you could see your ticket as very cheap.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any issues I've tried to pick out really are niggles. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and it was an unexpected surprise for our trip.
            The staff were very professional and friendly. We felt like we were being guided into a theatre rather than a cinema (the place was
            racking up bonus points all the way to the screen).
