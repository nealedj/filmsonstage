- drinkStatic

drinkStatic is a minimalist static blog engine for Django inspired by the PHP eatStatic library.
It's aimed at developers and designers to be as unobtrusive as possible.

- Getting started

Add the /drinkstatic directory to your Django application and add the application to its settings file:

   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       ...
       'drinkstatic',
   )

Add the directory where your blog files will be kept to the settings file:

    DRINKSTATIC_TEMPLATE_DIRS =(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../templates/cinemas'),)

Add the url prefix (if any) that you'd like to use for your blog urls:

    BLOG_URL = 'cinemas'

Add 'drinkstatic.context_processors.drinkstatic' to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS:

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS + (
        'drinkstatic.context_processors.drinkstatic',
    )

Load the drinkStatic tags in all of your blog files: {% load drinkstatic_tags %}

Use the drinkStatic tags to define the blog. At a minimum, the blog should have a title:

    {% titletext %}4U at Theatr Gwaun, Fishguard{% endtitletext %}{
